            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Societal Engineering </h1><p>"Societal engineering" is just a way to indicate the discrepancy between how we go about doing any coordinated, intentional task versus how we go about living... in our societies, we should be mindful of what we do, why we really do it, and whether or not it works.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1f742f206a26c58af1ce42047fcc7204fe93a52c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Academy- Citizenship and Duty</h1><p>I thought I'd resurrect this post, seeming as it has been a long time since I originally wrote it and precious little has changed (if anything has, it has probably been for the worse!)... Officium unum, omnes officium "Duty to one, Duty to all" Nobility is not a matter of privilege; it is a matter of solemn responsibility and service.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/26c5db90c46633f9cb73de4ddcfe24d792428499.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Fortunately, I had three years to get up close and personal with the term while I served as an AmeriCorps*VISTA and, later, a VISTA Leader.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e44ed781a3f4821d0ab102e850c15cd9aa414a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
