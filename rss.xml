            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Doing our duty...</h1><p>Part of the problem is that we need to stop waiting for someone else to lead, to inspire, to question, and to risk and step up to bar ourselves... We keep looking to the Founders as if they had something that we lack when we have the same capacities- perhaps more, even, given that we have works of literature, philosophy, technology, and science that did not exist in their day!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8523130a196148abcbdc5c90da358053e7f19980.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Societal Engineering </h1><p>"Societal engineering" is just a way to indicate the discrepancy between how we go about doing any coordinated, intentional task versus how we go about living... in our societies, we should be mindful of what we do, why we really do it, and whether or not it works.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1f742f206a26c58af1ce42047fcc7204fe93a52c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Academy- Citizenship and Duty</h1><p>I thought I'd resurrect this post, seeming as it has been a long time since I originally wrote it and precious little has changed (if anything has, it has probably been for the worse!)... Officium unum, omnes officium "Duty to one, Duty to all" Nobility is not a matter of privilege; it is a matter of solemn responsibility and service.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/26c5db90c46633f9cb73de4ddcfe24d792428499.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Real Epiphanies- Thoughts on changing the world </h1><p>"Sustainability" is often bandied about as if it were a banner for a new age, but few of us spend enough time with the term to truly come to terms with what it actually means. Fortunately, I had three years to get up close and personal with the term while I served as an AmeriCorps*VISTA and, later, a VISTA Leader.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e44ed781a3f4821d0ab102e850c15cd9aa414a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
